# HousePriceChange

This repository is for creating a tool that can calculate relative house price changes using a set location and point in time as the basis of the comparison.  

Input data for the tool is the UK House Price Index (UKHPI), monthly published by the UK Government:

The geographical breakdown of the UKHPI is Census boundary data, which is explained here:

And the coding system is described here:
